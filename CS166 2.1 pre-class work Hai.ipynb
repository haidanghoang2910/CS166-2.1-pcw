    "For #PythonImplementation, I have not done too well, since I could not finish and come up with a satisfactory simulation. The pros are that my simulation does work, and it uses the appropriate data structure which is a heap (to implement a priority queue). I have also incorporated object-oriented programming in defining two classes (the Queue class and the GroceryStore class) in implementing the model - this has benefits especially in the long run, for example in the assignment, since it's easier to refer to and remember different attributes of the same object. I also think that the simulation is displayed in an easy-to-understand way - we easily see how many people are in the queue, how many people are being served, the current time, and finally the total number of people served.\n",
    "For #CodeReadability, I have been consistent with the object-oriented programming style, and I have provided docstrings and in-line comments to explain major classes and functions. I also named the variables so that they match what they represent (although I realize some variable names are quite long). Therefore, I think my code is highly readable."
